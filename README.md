<h1>Hi ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to my Movie Recommender Project</h1>
  <h3>This project is a basic demonstration of how vectorization and Scikit-learn's cosine similarity function work. I have tried to keep the project as simple as possible, taking help from various sources such as ChatGPT, YouTube, module documentations, etc.</h3>
  <h4>While developing this project, I encountered several issues. One major issue was data pre-processing to extract only the data that helps recommend movies. There are several columns in the dataset, and filtering out only the part that can provide almost accurate results was challenging.</h4>

  <h1>What did I learn from it?</h1>
  <h3>While developing this recommendation system, which is my very first machine learning project, I learned many new things. I have listed all the skills and topics I have learned below.</h3>
 <li>Vectorization of the dataset</li>
    <li>Cosine similarity between two data points</li>
    <li>Using Pandas for data import and data pre-processing</li>
    <li>Python's lambda function</li>

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a simple movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system recommends movies based on their similarity to a given movie, utilizing vectorization and cosine similarity.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains various features about movies. Key features include movie titles, genres, directors, and cast members. The data is pre-processed to extract relevant information that contributes to accurate movie recommendations.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Suryanshu1005/Movie-Suggester-.git
   cd Movie-Suggester
   ```
